|\ printer3|a4|u4.4 Output bannersThe standard printer server identifies the head of each output document with a banner, which consists of the station number of the client which generated the message and some text specified by the operator.  There is also a facility to place control characters before and after the banner text, to support printers which allow double size printing or similar emphasis.  Finally, some text can be specified to be printed at the end of a document : this usually provides a form-feed so that the next user's output starts on a new page.  These details must all be set up manually each time the printer server is started.In this printer server, there is much more information available : the time of day when the spooling started, ended and was actually printed, and the user name.  The required text can also be kept in a file, requiring no manual intervention and allowing a much larger personalised banner, perhaps including graphical data to print a company logo.The system implemented has one file for each printer, which can contain a personalised header, message of the day, or whatever is required.  A number of symbolic parameters are recognised and replaced by the relavent values when each document is printed :|a17|T30<username><station>	Station number<mark>	Set origin for <tab><tab nnn>	Tab to nth column from mark<now>, <start>, <end>	Select which version of time-of-day<date>	1..31<st>	Prints st, nd, rd, or th depending on date<monthname>	eg.
