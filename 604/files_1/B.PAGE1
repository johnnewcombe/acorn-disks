Gordon|vApproximate word count|z : ??,000 words|uInitial Aims of ProjectPrior to the start of this project, the candidate had developed a fileserver program for the Acorn Econet network, which ran on a variety of hardware.  A new hardware design had been produced, specially tailored to the requirements of the fileserver, and the purpose of this project was to exploit the potential of this hardware.  There were three initial aims : to introduce multi-tasking, to design and implement a printer spooling system, and to give some consideration to support for magnetic tape.|uWork CompletedThe first two aims were accomplished according to schedule, but initial testing indicated that further work was required to achieve the full benifits of multi-tasking.  As stated in the progress report, it was decided to spend the remaining time on the design and implementation of a cache of directory sectors rather than providing support for magnetic tape, although the requirements of tape have been considered in the design of other parts of the system.|w|T15,50|u|cContents|i10|b1.
