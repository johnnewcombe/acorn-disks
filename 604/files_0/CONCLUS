|\ conclus|u6. ConclusionsThe introduction of multi-tasking has achieved the main aim of improving the unpredictable performance of the fileserver under heavy load.  The clients now observe a gradual decrease in performance as the load from other clients is increased.  There has also been an increase in overall performance : while this has not been as great as might have been hoped, mainly because the disc is quite fast in relation to the program, it is worthwhile.The directory cache has alleviated the substantial bottleneck in the original design, but perhaps points out a defect in the system architecture.  If the whole machine were to be designed again, a facility to map parts of the (external) cache memory into the memory map of the main processor would be a substantial improvement.  The use of two processors, however, has been very successful, and would be retained in such a future design.The printer serving enhancements have been generally satisfactory; the only problem is in the 'user interface' : it has not been possible to hide the fact that the new facilities do not fit comfortably on the restrictive standard protocols, and unexpected effects can occur under some error conditions.|w|gappendix
