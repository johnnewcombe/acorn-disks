Introduction|t3The Econet system was announced in December 1981 by Acorn Computers Ltd. of Cambridge. It is a general purpose communication system for small computers. In particular, it allows the various computers connected to the network to share expensive resources, such as disc drives and printers, at a relatively low cost (about #70) for the interface on each station. Since the initial launch, the system has been substantially improved, and version 3 has recently been released to allow for the requirements of the BBC Computer.|t3One of the largest markets for these products is in education - schools, colleges, and universities all have a requirement for a large number of computers to give 'hands on' experience to as many pupils as possible. The financial restraints imposed on these institutions have always resulted in a difficult choice between many computers of limited capacity, and few computers with greater capabilities. Networks ease this problem substantially by allowing disc drives and printers to be shared between many computers : these are the most useful and most expensive items which make the difference between the two types of computer to be selected. With a network, most of the facilities of an expensive, disc based computer can be provided for little more than the price of a machine which relies on slow, cumbersome audio cassettes for storage.|t3Acorn have produced Econet interfaces for all their small computers, which are based on the 6502 microprocessor, but not for any other machines. SJ Research have developed interfaces for the Research Machines 380Z and various systems based on the S100 bus, with software support for the CP/M operating system. The initial design work was performed by pupils and ex-pupils at Felsted School.|w|u3. Types of network|t3Networks fall into three categories according to their layout - Rings, Stars or Busses.|t3Stars are the most straightforward : one central machine is connected to all others individually. Machines can only communicate with each other by sending messages to the master for forwarding. This has the disadvantages of long cables (expensive) and heavy load on the central computer, which must be both powerful and reliable. ******dubious below*******|t3Rings have many advantages : each machine is connected to two neighbours, and messages circulate until the destination station is reached, where they are marked as having been received and continue back to the station they started from to indicate successful transmission. Advantages are good performance for a reasonable cost, and good detection of error conditions ; the main disadvantage is that the network topology is fixed : stations cannot be added or removed without disrupting other users and the failure of one station's ring interface is likely to disrupt the whole system.|t3In a Bus type network, all stations are connected to the same piece of cable in parallel, and each waits for the line to become free before starting to transmit. The most serious problem is that several stations may simultaneously discover that the line has become free and attempt to transmit together - this results in a 'collision'. The advantages are very low cost (extremely important in the education market) and the ability to connect and remove stations at will.|w|u4. Econet principles|t3The Econet is a Bus type network, chosen for reasons of cost and because the computers likely to be attached to it are portable. Other types demand a fixed, or severely restricted, configuration rather than this flexibility where connecting to the network is as easy as plugging in the power. With a system like this it is easy to move computers from room to room as demand requires, and it costs very little to provide sockets in each room of the building as the sockets are very cheap.|t3The detection of collisions is one of the most difficult design problems in a network of this type, and the Econet is no exception. Collisions are not as infrequent as it might at first appear - it is not simply a case of two stations coincidentally choosing the same moment to transmit which would be very rare (the times would have to coincide to within about 10 microseconds). More often, two stations wish to transmit while another is already using the network and are waiting for the line to become free, whereupon both stations jump in at once. The design approach on the Econet is to detect electrically when two devices have their outputs enabled onto the network simultaneously.|t3The software ensures that each message has the source station number in the same place (near the start) which means that any two messages involved in a collision are guaranteed to have different data in them. When two devices are simultaneously driving the network with different data, the resistance of the outputs will be such that an average of the two opposite voltages will be produced. A comparator measures the line voltage and provides a signal to interrupt transmission if such an intermediate voltage is detected. When a collision is detected, a 'collision arbitration' algorithm must be used to select which machine will be allowed to transmit first.|x..gprin2
