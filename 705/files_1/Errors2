|\ Errors2|u&C4, 196  Already ExistsAn attempt to RENAME a file when a file already exists with the new name is not allowed.|u&C6, 198  Disc fullThere is insufficient free space on the disc.  Note that there may be unexpected overheads if saving a file requires a directory to be extended, and that a file longer than 16K incurrs an overhead of 1K for each 512K of extent.  It is possible to create files of large extent where the data blocks do not all exist - unwritten blocks will read back as zeros, and disc space must be found when they are first written.  All disc space allocation is in units of 1K.|u&C6, 198  Account xx BankruptThe account to be charged for the current operation does not hold suficient credit.  Accounts are charged in the same way as disc space is allocated : see notes under 'Disc Full' concerning overheads.  When a file is created, it is charged to the account of the directory in which it exists.  If *ACCOUNT is used subsequently to change the account, the disc space taken by the file will be charged to the new account and re-credited to the old; the space taken by the directory entry is still charged to the account of the directory.|u&C7, 199  Disc ErrorA media error occured while trying to read the disc.  Disc errors have serious consequences for the integrity of the system and should be reported to the system manager, as they may indicate an impending problem with the disc or disc drive.|u&C8, 200  Disc changedThe disc has been changed.  Log on again with *I AM.|u&CC, 204  Bad nameThe filename used is illegal.  Filenames may not contain the characters $ % . ^ or : except where they are used for their special meanings - $ meaning the Root, for example.  Control characters and spaces are not allowed at all.|u&CC, 204  Bad wildcardA wildcard character has been used where this is not allowed.  Wildcards are not allowed in the filename used to create a file (although they may appear in the directory name in any context), or in passwords.  This error will also occur if the number and types of wildcards do not match in the two filenames in a *RENAME command.|u&CF, 207  Bad attributeOne of the attributes specified in a *ACCESS command is not one of the permitted attributes P D L W or R.|u&D6, 214  xxx not foundThe specified file, disc or directory could not be found.  Note that files or directories to which you do not have ownership will not be found if the Private access attribute is set.|u&DE, 222  ChannelThe channel number specified does not refer to a file which is open.  This errorcan be caused by closing a file channel too soon, but the most common reason is that the 'context handles' have been lost.  These handles are required for almost all fileserver operations, and can be lost by powering off the computer, using software which overwrites memory illegally (especially games), or due to various bugs in the Acorn NFS ROM.  The solution is to log on again with *I AM xxx.|u&DF, 223  EOFAn attempt has been made to read data beyond the end of a file.|u&FD, 253  Bad StringThe text string supplied is illegal, due to mis-matched quotes or an incomplete | sequence.
