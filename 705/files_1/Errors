|\ ErrorsThe following is a list of the errors which can be generated from the SJ Research File Server.  Note that further errors may be generated from the filing system in the local computer.  Although the error numbers given below are those returned by the file server, they are not necessarily the numbers finally seen by the user's program (ERR in Basic, for example).  Error numbers less than &A8 will be converted to &A8 by the Net Filing System, although an OSWORD call is available to read the actual value.  The main reason for detailing error numbers is that some less common errors do not produce an explanatory message but instead produce 'FS unusual error XX', where XX is the hexadecimal error number.  Where the same error can occur on an Acorn file server, the same error number is used.|u&01  Nothing happenedThis error results from the use of a wildcard in a context where it may specify several files, *DELETE for example.  Either there were no files which matched the filename, or errors occured while processing those that did match.  In the latter case, the individual errors can be found by repeating the operation with one of the files named explicitly.|u&03  Not in password fileA user with no entry in the password file has attempted to set a password or boot option.  This error usually occurs because a user has mis-spelt his username when logging on.|u&04  Bad numberA number has been incorrectly specified.  The number may be in the wrong base, larger than the maximum value allowed, or simply not supplied at all.|u&05  Too deepThere is a limit to the depth of the directory heirarchy : an attempt has been made to exceed it.|u&06  Too shortIf the system manager has set the appropriate flag in their password file entries, users are prevented from SAVEing files shorter than 16 bytes, in order to guard against the possibility of pressing BREAK before saving a program, for example.  If it is necessary to create a short file, this may be done by means of OPENOUT and BPUT.|u&07  Circular RENAMEWhilst directories may be renamed into other directories, it is not possible to rename a directory into itself or one of its sub-directories as this would create a ircular structure of directories.|u&35, 53  File too bigFiles may not exceed 8M bytes in length.|u&46, 70  Illegal attributeAn attempt has been made to set an illegal combination of attribute bits : setting read or write access to a directory, for example.|u&4F, 79  Bad ARG to examineThe argument to one of the examine (catalogue) calls is out of range.|u&85, 133  Not supportedThe file server function code is not one of the recognised values.|u&6D, 109  Bad ARG to read argumentsThe argument to the call to read random access information is out of range.|u&90, 144  Bad timeThe set time function has been called with a time or date that is invalid (eg. 32nd August).|u&AE, 174  Not logged onThe specified user is not logged on to this file server.  This error arises from utilities such as *NOTIFY FRED hello.|u&B0, 176  Renaming across discsIt is not possible to transfer a file from one disc to another by use of *RENAME.|u&B3, 179  Directory fullA directory cannot contain more than 255 entries.|u&B4, 180  Directory not emptyIt is not possible to delete a directory unless it is empty (ie. contains no files or other directories).|u&B5, 181  xxx is a directoryIt is not possible to LOAD a directory or to open it for output.  While is is possible to open a directory for input, any attempt to use BGET will cause this error.  The error may also be caused by an attempt to create a file of the same name as an existing directory.|u&B8, 184  Too many usersThe file server has a pre-set maximum number of users (currently 40).  This error may occur when there are fewer stations if the station numbers of some stations have been changed and they are logged on to the file server under both numbers.  The solution is to stop and re-start the file server.|u&B9, 185  Bad passwordPasswords have the same restrictions as file names concerning illegal characters.  In addition, no wildcards are allowed.|u&BA, 186  Insufficient PrivilegeThis error occurs when a user without system privilege attempts to perform some privileged operation, such as editing the password file.  On the hard disc file server, privileged users will also encounter this error if the security switch is not in the system position.  This error can also be caused by a user attempting to change his password or boot option, if this has been prohibited by the system manager.|u&BB, 187  Wrong passwordThe password specified in the *I AM or *PASS command does not match that stored in the pasword file.|u&BD, 189  Insufficient accessThe user does not have sufficient access to the file or directory in question.  If the main or auxiliary account numbers occur in the list of accounts associated with the user he has 'Owner' access, otherwise he has 'Public' access.  Random access reading or writing of files is controlled by the W and R access attributes : those before the / apply to owners and those after the / to public users.  To create a new file, the user must have owner access to the directory in which it is to be created.  To SAVE a file over one of the same name, owner access is required to the file and it must not be locked, but the W and R attributes are not checked.Users may check the access attributes and account numbers of files or directories by use of *INFO (the accounts are the last two items displayed), and may check their own list of accounts by use of the *STATEMENT utility.|u&BE, 190  xxx is not a directoryThe name of a file has been specified in a context where a directory is required - for a catalogue or as the directory to search for a file.|u&BF, 191  Who are you?The user is not logged on to the file server, and should use the *I AM command to log on.|u&C0, 192  Too many files openThere are 8 channels available, of which two are permanently allocated to the Library and User Root Directory.  In addition, the currently selected directory may require one, and one is required during the execution of the *DIR command.  The remainder may be used for random access files.|u&C1, 193  File not open for updateEither the random access file in question has been opened for reading only, or the access attributes of the file are W only (not WR).  In the latter case, the access to the file is extend only, so an error will occur if an attempt is made to write other than at the end of the file.|u&C2, 194  Already opened by xxxxThe file or directory has already been opened by the specified user (and possibly by others).  It is not possible to delete files or directories which are open, nor to write to files.  It is only possible to read files which are already open if they have been opened for input only.  Note that each user is considered to have opened his User Root Directory, Library, and Currently Selected Directory.|gerrors2
