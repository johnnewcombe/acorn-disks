|\ Upgrad1|u 3.1 SJ Research additionsThe SJ Research file server supports the wildcards * and # for multiple and single charcters respectively.  These may be used to specify a group of files for *DELETE or *ACCESS, or to specify a single file eg LOAD ":se*.bas*.lon*" would load :second.basicprogs.longname if this was the first file to match the description.  Disc space accounting is provided - 256 accounts are provided, each with an individual limit.  There is no restriction on the total allocated between all accounts, so the system may be tightly or loosely controlled.  A cache is provided to speed disc access.  Access controls have been adjusted to give more flexibility, but may still be set up to mimic the Acorn system.Most of the features intended are now implemented, although a few extra features will appear in later versions.  All of the standard calls available to applications programs (eg. OSFILE with various parameters) are supported and should work.  Most of the description in 'The Econet System User Guide' of the Acorn file server now applies.  Atom computers are not fully supported, and may never be so unless some particular interest is shown.|w
