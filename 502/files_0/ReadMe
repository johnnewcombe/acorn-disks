Known bugs in this release:Single user mode as described in the manual is not currently implemented.You must have local mail set up (i.e. LocDir and LocPath files must be compiled from LocText using Loc).The access of the file InDemo needs to be changed to wr/wr so that anyone can read it (this file will be found in the library).Loc entries should not point to the default trays (ISdata.Intray or ISdata.Outtray).  This means you must not use the pathname "" in a Loc file.The overnight software must own the account or auxilliary account of the ISdata directory in the library.Sometimes the *LOC command may not enter the Loc software but start another ROM instead.  This only occurs the first time, when the LocRom is loaded from the filing system and subsequent *LOC commands will work.
