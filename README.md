# Disk Images from Andrew Gordon (Acorn & SJ Research)


Please note that only successfully imaged disks have been published here, i.e. disks where all data has been recovered. For information about other images, contact _**john@glasstty.com**_.

Whilst many of these disk images are Acorn DFS format disks, not all are, see below.


## Image formats.

* SCP - A raw flux image of the disk showing all sectors, these can be viewed graphically with the HxCFloppyEmulator software.
* HFE - Standard HFE format.
* IMG - Single or double sided image as raw data. Double sided disks are stored as _**track interleaved**_ images **not** _**sequential**_ images.
* SSD & DSD - Single or double sided image as raw data. Double sided disks are stored as _**track interleaved**_ images **not** _**sequential**_ images.

Note that in the case of Acorn disks, the _.IMG_ files can be renamed to a _.dsd_ or _.ssd_ for use with emulators such as MAME. The _.IMG_ format can often be identified by the file size, otherwise tools such as the HxCFloppyEmulator software can be used.

The categories below represent the boxes, and sections within the boxes as labeled. The disks are sorted based on the boxes and sections they were in, rather where they should perhaps be. For example, it is highly likely that not all of the disks in the _Z80_ section of _Box A_, are Z80 related.

The disks in section 0 are the additional disks that were received via special delivery.

## 10 - Disks with Errors

In section 10 below are listed the disks that have not been fully imaged due to bad sectors being present. In these cases more work can be done to try and recover the data however, as this can be a time consuming precess, it has been though best to perform this task on an ad-hoc basis one the disks have damaged disks have been properly reviewed.

The .scp file for these disks can be viewed and exported with the HxCFloppyEmulator software, available from the following link.
