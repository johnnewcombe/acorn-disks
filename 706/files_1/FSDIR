{ FSDIR  File Server Directory management }{    Directory FormatŠEach directory is a file and contains a number of entries which may be eithercatalogue entries or extention entries containing more of the block list fora given file. Disc allocation is typically performed in 1K blocks and eachentry in a block list is 2 bytes, allowing 64 Mbytes for each logical disc.he entries form a linked list to allow easy alphabetic sorting, each linkbeing an entry number rather than a byte offset. The entries are fixed at 48bytes each to allow direct scanning for free entries. End of list is indicatedby a link to an out-of-use entry.Directory format:Byte 0      Cycle numberBytes 1-2   Pointer to 1st entryBytes 3+    EntriesCatalogue entry format:Bytes 0-1   Link to next entry, 32767 if this entry not in use.Bytes 2-11  File name, terminated CR if less than 10 chars.Bytes 12-15 Load addressBytes 16-19 Execute addressBytes 20-22 File sizeByte 23     Access byte - 6 lower bits in order DLWR/WRBytes 24-28 Date then timeByte 29     SpareBytes 30-47 Block listExtention entry format:Bytes 0-1   Link to next entry, negated to indicate extention.Bytes 2-47  Block list}PROCEDURE Find(dir:INTEGER;fname:$STRING10);BEGINEND;PROCEDURE Make(dir:INTEGER;fname:$STRING10);BEGINEND;
