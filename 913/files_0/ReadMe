Known bugs in this release:Loc entries should not point to the default trays (ISdata.Intray or ISdata.Outtray).  This means you must not use the pathname "" in a Loc file.Sometimes the *LOC command may not enter the Loc software but start another ROM instead.  This only occurs the first time, when the LocRom is loaded from the filing system and subsequent *LOC commands will work.
